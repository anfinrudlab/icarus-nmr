  :alt: application level graphical user interface

The main application graphical user interface (GUI) is divided into three main sections (columns).

The left column shows three graphs and table. The graphs are from the previous full cycle: top: pressurization, middle: depressurization and bottom: full period. The table shows the analysis of the full period.

The middle column shows the logged history and consists of four graphs(from top to bottom): (i) Pressure difference between end of pressurization and just before depressurization; (ii) Pressure after the pressurization; (iii) slope of the pressurization blue and depressurization green; (iv) time to switch between when the signal to switch was sent and actual pressure change occurred. blue - pressurization and green - depressurization; with light shade corresponding to approximated values at the sample.

the right column, from top to bottom:

* server selector
* Pressure in kbar for Target and sample
* pulse counter and number of pulses per pump stroke
* three different operation modes: manual, pulsed and console_counter
* the emergency shut down button
* pump on/off button
* two buttons for manual pressurization and depressurization
* message field for faults and warnings
